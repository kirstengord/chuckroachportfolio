            I was born in Albany Texas, and grew up in Novice, 
            in Coleman County. There were eleven in my graduating class, 
            and it was one of the big ones. We had no art teacher. 
            Since nobody else was interested, I usually did any art at 
            school that needed to be done. When it was time to go to 
            college, I went to Tarelton, majored in History and minored 
            in German. A History degree is fairly useless, so after college, 
            I sampled the family profession--oilfield labor.  
            Every man in my family for the last four generations was a 
            roughneck (worker on a drilling rig) at some time or other.  
            It was educational, but not the kind of job you want for a career.   
            After three years as a roughneck, I got certified to teach secondary school. 
            I taught seniors at Merkel High School for 28 years (Government, 
            Geography, G.T., etc.). During this time, I did portraits as my part 
            time job. As soon as I qualified to draw a retirement check from TRS, 
            I became a full time artist. My first retail location was at the 
            Harvard hotel, in Ft. Davis. I also sell art in Taos, New Mexico, (Heritage Gallery, 
            across the street from the Kit Carson House),  
            Alpine Texas, (The Texas Ranch House Too), 
            Granbury Texas, (Your Private Collection Art Gallery), 
            Fredericksburg, (Texas Jack Outfitter), and Abilene, (Shira Jewelry). 
            I am also a Freemason, (Merkel lodge #710, Abilene lodge #559) and I 
            do a lot of Masonic portraits.</p>
